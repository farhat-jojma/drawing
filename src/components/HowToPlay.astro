<h2>How to Play Pixel Drawing</h2>
<p>Are you ready to create colorful art using tiny squares? Let's get started! First, move your mouse over the blank grid. Click on any square to add a pixel in your chosen color. Want to try a different shade? Simply select a new color from the palette and continue clicking on the grid.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, don’t worry! Just click the eraser tool to remove any unwanted pixels. As you fill in each square, watch your picture come to life—it might be a bouncing puppy, a sparkling rainbow, or a delicious slice of pizza.</p>
<p>Once you’re satisfied with your design, press the Save button to keep your artwork forever. You can also tap Share to show your creation to friends. Dive in, enjoy yourself, and see your very own pixel masterpiece come to life!</p>
